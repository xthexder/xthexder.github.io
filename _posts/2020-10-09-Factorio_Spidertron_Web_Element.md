### [Factorio Spidertron Web Element](https://github.com/AlternativeFFFF/spidertron)

As a fun side-project I decided to animate a copy of the Spidertron from [Factorio](https://factorio.com/) for the community-run [Alternative Friday Factorio Fan Facts](https://alt-f4.blog/) blog as an easter egg.
This was achieved using CSS animations and JavaScript, with some careful optimization done to not slow down the page for smartphone users.
A more detailed write up was posted as part of [issue #12](https://alt-f4.blog/ALTF4-12/) of the Alt-F4 blog.
You can play around with the standalone demo hosted [here](https://spidertron.alt-f4.blog/), or find it at the bottom of any Alt-F4 page.

The source code is available of github here: https://github.com/AlternativeFFFF/spidertron
