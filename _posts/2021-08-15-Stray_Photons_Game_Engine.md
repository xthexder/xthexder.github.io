I've been building game engines in various forms since I was in high school. They have a huge variety of problems to solve, and they've taught me a lot about software architecture, algorithms, and programming techniques.  
In 2021 when I had the opportunity to start a company with [Justin Li (@pushrax)](https://github.com/pushrax), the goal was to release an indie VR game called [Stray Photons](https://strayphotons.net) based on a custom engine.

Stray Photons implements a number of unique game mechanics based around reflecting and combining light, while supporting physics-based VR interactions and immersive load-free scene transitions.

The project has always been designed in a modular way that isn't too game-specific, so as the game development progressed, the project evolved to being more of a sandbox game engine rather than just a single game title.  
You can find out more about the current state of the project on its [GitHub Page](https://github.com/frustra/strayphotons).
