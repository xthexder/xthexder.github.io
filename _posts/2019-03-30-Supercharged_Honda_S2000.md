I've done a lot of work on my car since I first bought it in 2017. Being a 2004 model year, it has Honda's 2.2L F22C1 engine, with a cable throttle and no traction or stability control systems (except ABS). The engine revs to 8200rpm and makes 240hp from the factory, however after modifying my car with an aftermarket supercharger kit in 2019, it is now making 427whp and redlines at 8400rpm.

I take the car to the track when I can, and have videos posted on my YouTube channel: [@jacobwirth](https://www.youtube.com/@jacobwirth/videos)

Occasionally I document the work I do on the car. One such occasion was when I upgraded the pulley system on the supercharger with that of a better design that happened to use the same compressor. There was not a lot of information available at the time to say how feasible this conversion was, so I posted my findings for others in the community.
