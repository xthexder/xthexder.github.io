On a short term contract for [turbopuffer](https://turbopuffer.com) (a cloud object-storage-based vector database), I built and released the first version of the **turbopuffer-python** API client. This is one of the main ways customers interact with the turbopuffer service, allowing large datasets to be uploaded to the database and queried for vector similarity.

The [turbopuffer-python API Client](https://github.com/turbopuffer/turbopuffer-python) is open-sourced on GitHub, and is [published as a PyPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/turbopuffer/).
