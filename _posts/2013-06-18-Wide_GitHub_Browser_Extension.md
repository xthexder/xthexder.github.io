One of my oldest projects that I still regularly maintain is this browser extension. I wrote this plugin to increase the width of the GitHub repository code view when I first got a large 4K monitor and was unhappy with still having to scroll left and right to read certain lines of text. GitHub's layout has vastly improved over the years, but this plugin is still maintained and functional on any pages that don't already take advantage of the full screen's width.
