  <p>
    I'm an experienced software engineer with a passion for graphics, software architecture, and performance optimization.
    I am fairly detail oriented and like knowing how things work, from mechanical systems like car engines to philosophy and logic.
    This site contains a showcase of some of the projects I've worked on both professionally and in my free time.
